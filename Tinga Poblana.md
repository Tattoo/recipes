# Tinga Poblana

https://www.cookwell.com/recipe/tinga-poblana

# Ingredients

## Pork
- 900 g pork shoulder
- salt (1% by weight)
- water
- 1 bay leaves

## Tinga poblana sauce
- 800 g whole peeled tomatoes
- 1 can (28oz) chipotles in adobo
- 2-3 garlic cloves
- dried oregano
- onions, thinly sliced
- 1 bay leaves
- salt to taste
- sugar to taste
- neutral oil

## Recipe

1. Cut the pork shoulder into 1-2" chunks. Season the meat with an even sprinkle of salt (about 1% of the meat weight). 

1. Add the salted meat to a pot or dutch oven. Fill with water until the meat is just submerged, and add a bay leaf to the pot.

1. Bring the water to a simmer, cover the pot, and then let the meat braise on low heat on the stovetop for 1-2 hours until tender and shreddable. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce or other serving ingredients.

1. Reserve about a cup of the cooking liquid, including some of the rendered fat that gathers at the top of the braise. Drain the rest of the liquid off, shred the pork pieces with a fork or by hand, and reserve.

1. To a blender or food processor, add the canned tomatoes, chipotles (and some of their liquid from the can), garlic, and oregano. Puree until smooth, using some of the reserved braising liquid to thin out the sauce until it blends easily.

1. Add a thin layer of oil to a large pan or dutch oven and saute the onions and bay leaf for 1-2 minutes until aromatic. Add the blended tinga sauce to the hot pan (be careful: it should fry and splatter some) and simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

1. Remove the bay leaf. Taste the tinga sauce and adjust with a sprinkle of salt and a spoonful of sugar (optional) for seasoning and balance.

1. Toss in the braised, shredded pork. Mix that up until incorporated. You want the flavor to develop, so turn the heat down and reduce until thickened, about 10 more minutes.

1. Serve on tostadas, tacos, tortas, etc.
