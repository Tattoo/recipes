# Slicked and Spicy Lamb Noodles

https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spicy-lamb-noodles-pasta-recipe

 # Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp. cumin seeds
- ½ cup (1,2 dl) extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 large shallots, thinly sliced
- salt
- 2 Tbsp. double-concentrated tomato paste
- 1 Tbsp. smoked paprika
- crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 lb. (450 g) ground lamb
- 1 lb. (450 g) pappardelle or other wide noodle
- coarsely chopped mint, plus more for serving

# Instructions

1. Coarsely grind 2 Tbsp. cumin seeds in mortar and pestle or spice mill. Set aside. 

1. Heat 1,2 dl extra-virgin olive oil in a large high-sided skillet over medium-high. Add 3 large shallots, thinly sliced, and season with kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots are softened and beginning to brown around the edges, 6–9 minutes. 

1. Add 2 Tbsp. double-concentrated tomato paste and stir to coat shallots. Cook, stirring often, until paste is darkened in color, about 3 minutes. 

1. Add 1 Tbsp. smoked paprika, 1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, and reserved cumin seeds. Cook, stirring, until spices are fragrant, about 30 seconds. 

1. Add 450 g. ground lamb and break up into small pieces with a wooden spoon; season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lamb is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and keep warm. 

1. Cook 450 g. pappardelle or other wide noodle in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving 2 cups pasta cooking liquid. Return pasta to pot off heat. 

1. Increase heat under lamb to medium and add 1 cup pasta cooking liquid; stir to combine. Add half of lamb and 1,2 dl coarsely chopped mint to pasta; cook over medium-low heat, tossing and adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed to loosen, until sauce coats pasta, about 2 minutes. Taste and season with more salt if needed.

1. Divide pasta among bowls; top with remaining lamb in skillet, then with more mint.
