https://www.seriouseats.com/polish-potato-kielbasa-cabbage-soup-kapusniak-recipe

# Ingredients
- vegetable oil
- 175 g slab bacon, cut into bite-size pieces
- 350 g kielbasa or other smoked Polish sausage, cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced (about 175 g)
- 1 medium carrot, cut into dice (about 120 g)
- 1 small head cabbage, cut into bite-size shreds (about 350 g)
- 220 g sauerkraut with juice 
- 1.9 l. chicken stock
- 2 bay leaves
- chopped fresh dill
- 1 large russet potato, cut into bite-size pieces (about 280 g)
- salt
- 1 tablespoon (10g) cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons (8g) paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon (2g) freshly ground white pepper, plus more for seasoning
- Fresh crusty bread, for serving

# Directions

1. Heat oil in a large soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add bacon and kielbasa and cook, stirring, until fat is rendering and bacon and sausage are browning in spots, about 5 minutes. 

1. Add onion and carrot and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. 

1. Add cabbage and cook, stirring, until lightly wilted, about 3 minutes. Add sauerkraut with its juice, chicken stock, bay leaves, dill stems, and potato. Season to taste with salt.

1. Increase heat to high and bring soup to a boil. Reduce to a bare simmer and cook until potato is tender, about 10 minutes. 

1. Stir together cornstarch, paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon white pepper in a small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) cold water and stir to form a slurry. 

1. Pour slurry into the soup and stir until evenly distributed. Return to a boil (soup should thicken very slightly). Season to taste with more salt and white pepper as desired. Stir in chopped dill and serve with bread.
