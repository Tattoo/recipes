https://old.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/sc1qad/thai_basil_chicken_noodle_bowl/

# Ingredients

- 8 ounces (~220 g) rice noodles
- 1 pound (~450 g) ground or thinly sliced chicken
- 2 shallots, peeled and diced
- 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 1–4 chili peppers minced depending on heat tolerance, or use crushed red pepper
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar (add more if you like it a little sweeter)
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- ¼ cup water plus more if needed
- 0.2 ounces Thai basil leaves stem discarded
- salt 
- pepper 
- Lime wedges for serving 

# Instructions

1. Prepare the rice noodles according to package instructions. Drain, rinse and set aside.

1. Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Once hot, add the chicken and cook, stirring regularly, for 7–8 minutes until mostly cooked through—season with salt and pepper.

1. Add the shallots, garlic, and minced chili peppers to the wok and cook for 2–3 minutes.

1. Whisk together the soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, and water in a bowl. 

1. Pour the sauce into the wok and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
Tear the Thai basil leaves in half. Add them to the wok and cook an additional 1–3 minutes until wilted.

1. Turn the heat on the wok to low. Add the cooked rice noodles and toss to coat in the sauce for 1–2 minutes. Once the noodles are warmed through, remove the wok from the heat.

1. Divide the noodles between bowls. Garnish with more Thai basil leaves and lime wedges. Enjoy!
