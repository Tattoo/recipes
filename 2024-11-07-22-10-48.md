Instructions

Prepare the rice noodles:

Prepare the rice noodles according to package instructions. Drain, rinse and set aside.
Cook the chicken:

Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Once hot, add the chicken and cook, stirring regularly, for 7–8 minutes until mostly cooked through—season with salt and pepper.
Cook the aromatics:

Add the shallots, garlic, and minced chili peppers to the wok and cook for 2–3 minutes.
Prepare the sauce:

Whisk together the soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, and water in a bowl. Set aside.
Finish the Thai basil chicken:

Pour the sauce into the wok and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
Tear the Thai basil leaves in half. Add them to the wok and cook an additional 1–3 minutes until wilted.
Sauce the noodles:

Turn the heat on the wok to low. Add the cooked rice noodles and toss to coat in the sauce for 1–2 minutes. Once the noodles are warmed through, remove the wok from the heat.
