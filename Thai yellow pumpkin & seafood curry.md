# Thai yellow pumpkin & seafood curry

https://www.nigella.com/recipes/thai-yellow-pumpkin-and-seafood-curry

# Ingredients

- 400 millilitres tin coconut milk
- 1 - 2 tablespoon thai curry paste 
- 350 millilitres fish stock
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce 
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 3 stalks lemongrass (cut into 3 and bruised with flat of knife)
- 3 makrut lime leaves (destalked and cut into strips)
- Â½ teaspoon turmeric
- 1 kilogram pumpkin 
- 500 grams salmon fillets 
- 500 grams peeled raw prawns
- pak choi (or any other green veg of your choice)
-  juice of 1 lime 
- 1 bunch fresh coriander 

# Method

1. Cut the lemongrass into three and bruise with flat of knife. Destalk lime leaves and cut into strips. Peeled the pumpkin and cut into bite sized chunks. Skinned the salmon and cut into large bite sized chunks. Cut pak choi / other veg if needed. 

1. Skim the thick creamy top off the tin of coconut milk and put it, over medium heat, into a large saucepan with the curry paste. Let it sizzle and, using a wooden spoon, beat milk and paste together until combined.

1. Still beating gently, add the rest of the coconut milk, fish stock, fish sauce, sugar, lemongrass, lime leaves and turmeric. Bring to a boil and then add the pumpkin. 

1. Cook on a fast simmer until the pumpkin is tender, about 15 minutes, although different sorts of pumpkins can vary enormously in the time they take to cook; some squash take as little as 5 minutes.

1. So, to the robustly simmering pan, add the salmon and prawns (if you're using the prawns from frozen they'll need to go in before the salmon). 

1. When the salmon and prawns have cooked through, which shouldn't take more than 3-4 minutes, stir in any green veg you're using.

1. When the pak choi's wilted, squeeze in the juice of half a lime, stir and taste and add the juice of the remaining half if you feel it needs it. 

1. Take the pan off the heat or decant the curry into a large bowl, and sprinkle over the coriander; the point is that the coriander goes in just before serving.

1. Serve with more chopped coriander and some rice.
